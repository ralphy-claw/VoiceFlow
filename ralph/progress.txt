# Ralph Progress Log — VoiceFlow
Started: 2026-02-12

## Codebase Patterns
- SwiftUI tab-based app with 3 tabs: Transcribe, Speak, Summarize
- OpenAIService is an actor for thread-safe API calls
- Config.swift holds API key (to be migrated to Keychain)
- Uses AVFoundation for audio recording/playback
- iOS 17+ target, modern Swift concurrency throughout
